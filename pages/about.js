        <p>
          My name is Keenan Leonard-Sol√≠s. I am a self-taught programmer
          currently living in northeastern Massachusetts. While I graduated from
          Swarthmore College in 2012 with a BA in Psychology, I have always had
          a penchant for learning and problem solving, and I'm perpetually
          thinking of ways of using technology to bring people together.
        </p>
        <p>
          My background is in municipal public safety, and I've spent the past
          13 years working in various capacities -- from On-Call Firefighter/EMT
          to Public Safety Dispatcher, and now my new role as a Dispatch
          Supervisor, a position I've held since 2016. Over the years, I've been
          motivated to find ways to bring technology and improvements to this
          field because a community benefits greatly if their public safety
          agencies are forward-thinking and striving to solve problems with the
          best technology available.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that our world would be a better place if more people knew
          a thing or two about the technology, infrastructure, and processes
          that make it run. To this end, I hope to one day use my programming
          knowledge and skills to help others find the spark for innovation and
          the passion for discovery that technology brings.
